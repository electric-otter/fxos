Welcome to the FX OS Wiki!

Welcome to the official wiki for FX OS, the open-source operating system built and shaped by the community. This project began as an idea I had, but since I didn’t know how to build the OS myself, I opened it up to the public for collaboration. Now, it’s a community-created OS, and everyone is invited to contribute, share ideas, and help make it better. :warning: Important Notice

While FX OS is an open-source project, you still need explicit permissions to make code edits. This ensures that the quality, security, and integrity of the project are maintained. Anyone can:

Suggest changes
Report issues
Contribute to documentation

However, pull requests that modify the core codebase will be reviewed and approved only by trusted maintainers. You are free to clone the repository and experiment with your own version, as FX OS is open-source. But remember, merging changes into the official project requires review.
